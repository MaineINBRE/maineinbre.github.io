Welcome to the [Maine INBRE](https://inbre.maineidea.net) Bioinformatics and Biostatistics training materials repository. Our goal is to provide high-quality training materials for biomedical research to interested undergraduates, graduate students, and faculty at different institutes throughout Maine.
